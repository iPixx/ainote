- Background cleanup runs every 5 minutes
- Immediate cleanup for completed operations

✅ **No memory leaks detected in stress testing**
- Leak detection monitors component growth over time
- Alerts on sustained memory growth patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage validates leak-free operation

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Memory Manager Architecture

```rust
pub struct MemoryManager {
    config: MemoryManagerConfig,
    allocation_tracker: HashMap<String, MemoryAllocation>,
    allocation_limiter: AllocationLimiter,       // AI operation limits
    leak_detection: HashMap<String, LeakDetectionEntry>,
    metrics_history: Vec<MemoryMetrics>,
    // Background monitoring and cleanup tasks
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Background task monitors every 10 seconds
   - Tracks allocations by component and type
   - Calculates memory pressure and usage metrics

2. **Allocation Tracking**
   - Every allocation tracked by ID, component, size, type
   - Automatic cleanup of stale allocations
   - Type-specific handling (EmbeddingCache, VectorStorage, AiOperation, etc.)

3. **AI Operation Limits**
   - Dedicated `AllocationLimiter` for AI operations
   - 50MB limit enforced across all AI operations
   - Request/release lifecycle management

4. **Leak Detection**
   - Monitors component memory growth over time
   - Detects sustained growth patterns (>0.01 MB/sec)
   - Alerts when growth exceeds thresholds

5. **Garbage Collection**
   - Automatic triggers at 75% memory usage
   - Manual trigger API for immediate cleanup
   - Background cleanup of inactive allocations

### Integration with Existing Systems

The new memory manager integrates seamlessly with existing codebase:

- **Embedding Cache**: Coordinates with existing LRU cache
